# MVP Use Case: In-Browser Web Component Creation with a Multi-Agent System

This document outlines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a system where a user collaborates with multiple AI agents to create a web component directly within the browser.

## Core Concept

The system provides a seamless, in-browser experience for developing, testing, and refining web components. All artifacts, including requirements, architectural diagrams, source code, and test results, are stored in the browser's IndexedDB, making them accessible to a suite of specialized AI agents and the user at any time.

## Example Workflow: Creating an `x-eyes` Web Component

The user initiates the process with a simple prompt: `"Create a web component that implements xeyes."`

### 1. Requirement Negotiation (Analyst Agent)

*   **User:** "Create a web component that implements xeyes."
*   **Analyst Agent:** "I can do that. Should the eyes be configurable? For example, would you like to be able to change the color of the sclera (the white part) or the iris?"
*   **User:** "Yes, I'd like to configure the sclera, iris, and pupil color."
*   **Analyst Agent:** *[Updates requirements document in IndexedDB]* "Got it. Requirements updated."

### 2. Architectural Design (Architect Agent)

*   **Architect Agent:** "Based on the requirements, I propose a component architecture that separates the eye into distinct parts: `<eye-ball>`, `<eye-iris>`, and `<eye-pupil>`. This will make it easier to manage and style each part independently. Do you approve this architecture?"
*   **User:** "That sounds good. Please proceed."
*   **Architect Agent:** *[Saves the component architecture plan to IndexedDB]* "Architecture saved."

### 3. Planning (Planner Agent & User)

*   **Planner Agent:** *[Generates an initial implementation plan (TODO list)]*
    ```
    - [ ] Implement `<eye-pupil>` component
    - [ ] Implement `<eye-iris>` component
    - [ ] Implement `<eye-ball>` component
    - [ ] Assemble the main `x-eyes` component
    ```
*   **User:** "Please add a step for testing the component's configurability."
*   **Planner Agent:** *[Updates the plan in IndexedDB]*
    ```
    - [ ] Implement `<eye-pupil>` component
    - [ ] Implement `<eye-iris>` component
    - [ ] Implement `<eye-ball>` component
    - [ ] Assemble the main `x-eyes` component
    - [ ] Write tests for color configuration
    - [ ] Run tests and review results
    ```

### 4. Development (Developer Agent)

*   The **Developer Agent** follows the plan, implementing each component. It writes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the web components, saving each artifact into IndexedDB. The user can observe the progress and review the code as it's being written.

### 5. Testing (Tester Agent & User)

*   The **Tester Agent** executes the tests defined in the plan.
*   **Tester Agent:** "Tests complete. All configuration options are working as expected. Here are the results..." *[Displays test results and a preview of the component]*
*   **User:** Reviews the results and the component preview, providing feedback or approving the final product.

## Key Features of the MVP

*   **In-Browser IDE:** All interactions and development happen within the browser. No local setup is required.
*   **Agent-Based Workflow:** Specialized agents for analysis, architecture, planning, development, and testing guide the project from conception to completion.
*   **User Collaboration:** The user is an active participant, negotiating requirements, approving plans, and reviewing results at each stage.
*   **Persistent Artifacts:** All project files (requirements, plans, code, tests) are stored in IndexedDB, ensuring persistence across sessions and accessibility for all agents.

This MVP demonstrates a powerful new paradigm for software development, leveraging AI agents to create a collaborative and efficient in-browser creative environment.
