# Multi-Agent Programming Loop - Claude Code Init Summary

## Project Overview
A professional web-based multi-agent development system that orchestrates autonomous software development workflows using Claude AI agents with human oversight. The system implements a continuous loop of specialized AI agents (Analyst → Planner → Developer → Tester) that collaborate to build software projects from requirements to production-ready code.

## Core Architecture

### Multi-Agent System
- **Analyst Agent**: Analyzes project requirements, identifies technical challenges, breaks down implementation components
- **Planner Agent**: Creates detailed technical specifications, architecture designs, and implementation roadmaps  
- **Developer Agent**: Writes production-ready code following modern web development standards
- **Tester Agent**: Conducts comprehensive testing including functionality, performance, accessibility, and security audits

### Workflow Loop
```
User Requirements → Analyst → Planner → Developer → Tester → [Human Approval] → Next Iteration
```

### Key Technologies
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript with modern ES6+ features
- **API Integration**: Real-time Claude API calls using Anthropic's `/v1/messages` endpoint
- **Architecture**: Standalone web application with no external dependencies
- **UI/UX**: Professional gradient design with interactive visualizations

## Core Features

### Professional AI Integration
- Real Claude API calls (not mocked) with proper error handling
- Context-aware agent communication with full conversation history
- Structured JSON responses between agents
- Configurable parameters (max tokens, iterations, temperature)

### Human-in-the-Loop Oversight
- Manual approval required between each agent step
- Rich feedback system with quick-tag selection
- Three approval modes: Approve & Continue, Request Revision, Reject & Stop
- Real-time feedback preview showing exactly what gets sent to next agent

### Advanced Workflow Management
- Intelligent context passing between agents
- Feedback history tracking across iterations
- Automatic tag extraction from human feedback (security, performance, accessibility, etc.)
- Dynamic output modification based on human input

### Professional Development Standards
- Production-ready code generation with comprehensive documentation
- Modern web component architecture (Custom Elements v1, Shadow DOM)
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1) and performance optimization
- Cross-browser compatibility testing and security assessments

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```javascript
currentState = {
    agent: 'analyst|planner|developer|tester',
    iteration: number,
    isRunning: boolean,
    projectDescription: string,
    history: Array<AgentOutput>,
    feedbackHistory: Array<HumanFeedback>,
    apiCallCount: number
}
```

### Agent Prompt Structure
Each agent has professional, comprehensive prompts that include:
- Role definition and responsibilities
- Context from previous agents
- Human feedback integration
- Structured JSON output requirements
- Professional coding standards and best practices

### API Integration Pattern
```javascript
const response = await fetch("https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
        max_tokens: 4000,
        messages: [{ role: "user", content: contextualPrompt }]
    })
});
```

## User Experience

### Visual Interface
- Interactive agent flow diagram with real-time active state indicators
- Professional gradient design with smooth animations
- Responsive layout supporting desktop and mobile devices
- Collapsible history with expandable output sections

### Workflow Controls
- Project configuration panel with description, max iterations, and token limits
- Real-time status tracking (current agent, iteration, progress percentage)
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions (Ctrl+Enter, Ctrl+R, Ctrl+P)
- Auto-save functionality for project descriptions

### Output Management
- Structured JSON display with syntax formatting
- Comprehensive iteration history with approval status tracking
- Export functionality for complete workflow results
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
